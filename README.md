Business Requirements Document SNHU23
The owner of DriverPass plans to develop a software that provides comprehensive driving training to individuals who have failed their driving license test due to lack of training. Our client wants to build a system that allows users to register for the course, select their package, receive online training, attempt online exams, and receive road training from a trainer. The system also provides the owner access to all accounts and files of employees and students, including the ability to delete accounts and receive notifications of new updates. The company's IT team has access to the software code and databases for troubleshooting.

What did you do particularly well?
I visually depicted how the application will perform and how different users will interact with the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would rework the activity diagrams and add more detail.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
By gathering the client's requirements and breaking them down into smaller, more manageable tasks. The importance of clear specifications cannot be overstated, as it is essential for delivering valuable items and completing the project successfully. By meticulously understanding and organizing the client's needs, I am able to ensure that our team is on the same page and working towards a common goal.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Initially, I plan to meticulously examine the previous version of the system and gather specific requirements for the new functionalities that need to be added. In doing so, I will ensure that the design of the system is tailored to these requirements. Furthermore, I will take into account any previous feedback or constraints that were encountered in the previous version of the system. This is crucial since I believe it is important to learn from past experiences in order to improve and avoid making the same mistakes again. I firmly believe that designing a new system without studying the previous version and feedback is a recipe for failure.
